## Database Information

Environmental, health and socioeconomic indicator data was downloaded from CalEnviroScreen, an environmental justice mapping tool used by the State of California. The tool was designed to help identify California communities that are most affected by many sources of pollution. The indicator data is used to derive a rank score; an area with a high score is one that experiences a much higher pollution burden than areas with low scores. Indicator data is taken from other up-to-date state and federal sources. The data is divided along 2010 census tract boundaries.
